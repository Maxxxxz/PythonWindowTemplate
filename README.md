# PythonWindowTemplate
A tkinter window template for Python.
This is mainly for me so that I don't have to go through the same process every time I want to create a GUI for a project.

I intend on updating this with other bundled things as I think of more that I may need frequently.

# Features

* Pages!
    * Simple Pages that you can easily implement yourself.
* Hotkeys
    * Swap to different pages using the control key combined with a number key. These are all customizable.
